# Mono-repo contributions

## Requirements

- [Yarn 1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) must be installed. Run this command to ensure you have Yarn 1.x available:

```bash
yarn -v
```

If successful this should print `1.xx.xx` (this should start with a 1).

## Install

Run this command which is short for `yarn install`:

```bash
yarn
```

You should then be able to development on the mono-repo.
